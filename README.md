# backup_script

This script backs up files and directories from the specified source path (ensure the reports directory exists) to your designated backup path using Python's os and shutil modules. The default source path is set to /home/dci-student/script-collection/reports, and the destination path is /home/dci-student/script-collection/Backup; make sure to replace these paths with your own if necessary. To use it, simply run the script in a Python environment after confirming that the source directory exists.
